Wazzup!

This is what we call progress! After 2 years of disappearing and them coming back in the time period and then after a long time I am opening github. This is my choice to improve life and take some good decisions. Yappin'.

"A person,
Shaped by fear, failures
Still fails against a person
A man who shall master all cards"
